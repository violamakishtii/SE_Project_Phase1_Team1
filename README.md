# Project Details 
## Project Title: "BIBA X" Project Management Web App 
## Problem Statement: 
Construction companies often face inefficiencies in project and task management, leading to delays, miscommunication, and cost overruns. The absence of a centralized system results in poor coordination between project managers, workers, and clients, making it difficult to track progress, manage resources, and control budgets effectively. Additionally, document handling, real-time collaboration, and risk management remain major challenges, impacting overall project efficiency. 
## Solution Proposed: 
To address the challenges identified in the construction industry, we propose the development of a Construction Project Management Web App that centralizes key project management processes. This solution will provide a single platform where project managers, workers, and clients can collaborate efficiently and monitor project progress in real time.
The application will allow project managers to create, assign, and track tasks, set dependencies, and visualize project timelines using interactive tools like Kanban boards or Gantt charts. Role-based access control will ensure that managers, workers, and clients have access to the features they need—managers can fully control the project, workers can update their progress, and clients can view important milestones and documents without modifying any data.
Additionally, the app will include robust features for document and blueprint management, resource tracking, budget monitoring, and risk management. This will help teams handle everything from material and equipment tracking to budget estimation and risk mitigation within one integrated system. While integration with QuickBooks for budget tracking is a potential enhancement, its implementation will be evaluated based on the complexity encountered during development.

The application will be built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend, PHP for the backend, and MySQL for the database.If there is needed to use other frameworks as well we will integrate those too in our project, to help us aim all the objectives and tasks. We will also integrate third-party APIs such as QuickBooks for accounting and Google Maps for location tracking.

## Project Scope: 
This project will develop a fully functional web-based application to manage construction projects, which will provide users with the tools they need to track and manage tasks, resources, budgets, and documents. The app will be accessible by project managers, workers, and clients with role-based access control.

Our project has some boundaries such as that the application will be a prototype for a small to medium-sized construction company and will not integrate real-time data from external construction systems. It will also be mainly focused on project management features, excluding advanced analytics or third-party integrations beyond QuickBooks and Google Maps.

The project will be limited to basic functionalities for task management, resource tracking, and budget estimation. It will not include advanced features like AI-based project forecasting or integration with multiple third-party systems beyond the core ones, such as QuickBooks. Additionally, due to time constraints, the application will not be tested with real data or deployed for live use in real-world construction projects.
*This project is web-only.*

Key Features of our project are:
- Task & Project Tracking – Assign, manage, and track tasks with dependencies.This enables the creation, assignment, and tracking of tasks, with dependencies (e.g., foundation must be completed before walls). The app will feature a Kanban board or Gantt chart for visual progress tracking, ensuring tasks are properly coordinated and deadlines are met.
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) – Define access levels for managers, employees, and clients.Implement customized roles for Project Managers, Employees/Workers, and Clients, ensuring that each user has the appropriate level of access (e.g., project managers can assign tasks, workers can update progress, and clients can only view progress without modifying tasks.
- Real-Time Collaboration – Enable comments and file sharing.Provide communication tools such as comment sections for each task, and the ability to share files (blueprints, designs, reports), ensuring all team members are aligned and informed in real-time.
- Document & Blueprint Management – Securely upload, store, and version control files. Allow users to upload, store, and version control important documents. Role-based access ensures that only authorized personnel can view or modify sensitive information.
- Resource & Inventory Management – Track materials, equipment, and workforce availability.Track the availability of materials, equipment, and workforce. The system will notify managers when resources are running low or when equipment needs maintenance, preventing delays due to shortages.
- Budget & Cost Estimation – Monitor expenses, invoices, and payments with potential QuickBooks integration. Integrate with QuickBooks to track project expenses, invoices, and payments. The app will also generate cost estimates based on project parameters, helping managers stay within budget.
- Risk Management – Identify and mitigate risks related to project delays and cost overruns. Enable the identification, logging, and mitigation of potential risks (e.g., delays, cost overruns). The app will provide tools for proactively managing risks and tracking the effectiveness of mitigation strategies.
- Third-Party API Integration – Support external tools like Google Maps for site tracking. Offer integration with third-party tools, such as QuickBooks for accounting, and Google Maps for site location tracking, enhancing the app’s functionality and ensuring seamless data synchronization with other platforms.
  
- **Aim:** The aim of the project is to create a web-based application that helps construction companies manage their projects more efficiently, reducing delays, miscommunication, and cost overruns by providing a unified platform for task management, communication, and resource allocation. 
- **Main Objectives:**
